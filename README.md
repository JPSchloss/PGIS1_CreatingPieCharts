# Creating Pie Charts with Google
### Programming For Information Science I

The aims of this assignment included collecting data from an API, conducting a simple analysis, and using Google Charts to create a pie chart. I ended up making four for this project to further experiment. The more complicated pie charts are terrible visualizations, and deserve a better presentation, but that would have been even further outside of the assignment.
